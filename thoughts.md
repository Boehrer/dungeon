## creatures
All sentient things in dungeon are creatures. Creatures always have a species and stats. Creatures can have a weapon and a hat.


### species
Species differentiate creatures via base stats


### stats
* stats determine a creatures power
* Each creature has one stat for strength, dexterity, magic, and charisma
* stats are between 0 and 9


### hats
* creatures can wear a hat
* worn hats give creatures a bonus


### weapons
* weapons are used to damage enemies
* weapons have one of the following categories: melee, ranged, magic


### attacking
* a roll is made to determine if the attack hits
* if the attack hits then the damage to the player is calculated by:
    weapon damage 


## rolls
rules:
* Non-trivial actions succeed or fail based on dice rolls
* all rolls are 1d20
* In order to succeed, the player needs to roll higher than the difficulty
* there are three difficulties, easy(5+), medium(10+), hard(15+)
* rolls are categorized by stat, and when a creature rolls they add their stat for that category
    to the number shown on the dice
* if a creature rolls a 1 that is a critical fail
* if a creature rolls a 20 that is a critical success


### excluded core stats
intelligence
perception
wisdom
agility
luck (na)
endurance


### thoughts about DnD
* resting is annoying
* leveling up is annoying
* there are too many stats
* there is too much rolling
* combat is too slow
* players should be rewarded for fast decisiveness
* melee can be strong because getting close incurs risk
* magic should be strong but easier to counter and more resource constrained than ranged
* ranged should be the "weakest" because it is reliable and ranged


### fighting cases
* if two identical creatures are melee fighting then:
* say a creature has 5 strength, 5 armor, and 5 damage attacks an identical creature.
